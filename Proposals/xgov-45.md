## Abstract
NFTs are the cornerstone of the Algorand blockchain, supporting over 1,000 artists and a loyal fanbase of die-hard collectors. After the recent relaunch of Rand Drops to complement Rand Gallery and NFT Explorer (NFTx), Rand wants to build the next dApp that the Algorand NFT community demands - Rand Auctions.

Rand, known for offering end-to-end NFT solutions from minting tools to data analytics, is creator-led and customer-focused. Rand Auctions will be an NFT auction dApp compatible with all of Rand’s products including Rand Gallery (Algorand’s #1 NFT Platform) and NFTx (Algorand’s #1 NFT analytics platform). The dApp will be smart contract-based, catering for both classic (timed) and Dutch auctions, to provide creators and collectors with another avenue to sell their NFTs.

Like Rand Drops, the auction site will be feature-rich (e.g. allow lists), intuitive, beautifully designed and integrated into the ecosystem (e.g. Evil Tools and NFDomains).

## Team
We are a team of Algorand OG’s, having participated in the first-ever Algorand accelerator in early 2021. Our multidisciplinary and experienced team of seven covers the commercial, tech and regulatory specialities required to successfully launch and grow Rand Auctions. 

Agash (https://www.linkedin.com/in/agash-navaranjan/, https://twitter.com/agashnava), Rand’s CTO, has primarily worked with Blockchain for the last eight years, having built systems in finance, healthcare and more recently tokenisation. He is a technical leader with hands-on programming experience. He was the lead inventor of a patent for secure data transfer on-chain. Agash is also an angel investor, NFT whale (1,200+ NFTs), blockchain advisor, and member of the Algorand NFT Council and Algorand Governance Committee.

Ross (https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossmurrayjones/, https://twitter.com/rossmurrayjones), Rand's CEO, has grown, launched and exited multiple startups since business school. He’s supported $40M+ in fundraising to spur fast growth, expanded internationally and set up commercial operations across Europe. Ross has won deals and managed partnerships with some of the world’s most recognisable brands (e.g. Amex, Red Bull, Smirnoff, Magnum, Telegraph) and mentors at Algorand Miami, Algorand Europe, AXL Ventures, Moonbeam Accelerator, BlockBeam and Entrepreneur First.

## Experience with Algorand
Rand’s development team has built NFT distribution, lending, trading, and staking platforms on Algorand, whilst contributing to multiple Algorand NFT projects since 2021.

Notably, Rand owns and operates successful NFT platforms Rand Drops (https://drops.randgallery.com/drops/create), Rand Gallery (https://www.randgallery.com/), and NFT Explorer (https://www.nftexplorer.app/).

Rand is proud to have developed a leading NFT position on Algorand (57% blended market share over the last eight months). Overall, Rand has transacted 400,000 NFTs and $19,000,000 GMV from over 15,000 wallets since inception. The ecosystem trusts us to provide a secure and reliable home for their NFTs.

This is a testament to the team’s commitment to delivering end-to-end NFT products and services that empower the community to create, research, manage, collect, and sell their digital assets at scale on Algorand.

## Benefits for the community
Auctions are one of Rand’s most highly requested features from Algorand’s active NFT community. The community can use this tool for any type of NFT currently supported by Rand Gallery and NFTx, including music, gaming, video and audio assets.

As the next bull cycle starts and enters its crescendo, NFT Auctions will be a key tool to support the Algorand NFT ecosystem. Auctions offer a valuable price discovery tool, within a gamified and fun environment, to spark growth and development.
